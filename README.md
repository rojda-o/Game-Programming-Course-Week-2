# Game-Programming-Course-Week-2
In the second week of the Game Programming course, I built a simple 3D game using Unity to practice key concepts like shooting mechanics and object management. <br>
This project demonstrates the following fundamental skills:

- Designing a basic laser prefab and setting its properties (size, material, and color).
- Writing C# scripts to handle laser shooting, movement, and destruction.
- Using Unity's `Update` function to manage continuous shooting, movement, and object deletion when off-screen.
- Implementing fire rate control to add a delay between consecutive laser shots. <br>

In this project, the player can fire lasers by pressing the spacebar and the lasers move upwards.  <br>
The shooting is controlled by a timer to ensure a proper firing rate. <br>
This project helped me better understand Unity's scripting system, prefabs, and game object management.
